may need the commands to install the required packages
`npm install --save three`
`npm install --save cannon`
`npm install --save-dev vite`
to install threeJS

Next steps:

We should be able to create a new class which inherits from DraggableSphere and customize the mesh, mass and radius to represent each school's mascot.

This could also include the score value, which will be a function of the mass. The current implementation recognizes when a sphere is clicked and changes
its color. The next step will be determining the mechanic for shooting the tiger at the other school's mascots.

If you need to switch back to your html file just comment out line 13 in index.html and uncomment out line 12.
